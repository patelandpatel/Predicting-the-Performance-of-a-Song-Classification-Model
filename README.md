# Predicting the Performance of a Song Classification Model ðŸŽ¶

This project explores a machine learning model to classify songs based on features such as genre, tempo, mood, and other audio characteristics. By analyzing these features, the model predicts how well a song might perform in terms of popularity or listener engagement.

## Introduction

Understanding what makes a song popular or how it might perform in different contexts is valuable for artists, producers, and music streaming platforms. This project builds a classification model that categorizes songs and predicts their potential success based on specific audio features. The goal is to provide insights into song performance by analyzing features like genre, tempo, loudness, and mood.

## Features

- **Classification of Songs**: Classifies songs based on predefined labels, such as genre or mood.
- **Performance Prediction**: Predicts potential song performance metrics like popularity or engagement.
- **Feature Analysis**: Provides insights into the impact of various song features on its classification and performance.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of song features from bb_2000s_train.csv and bb_2000s_test.csv, which include columns related to song attributes and target classifications. These data files are used for training and testing models in the project.

The dataset used in this project includes various audio features for songs, such as:

- Genre
- Tempo
- Loudness
- Danceability
- Energy
- Valence (mood positivity)

Datasets from sources like [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) or [Kaggle's Million Song Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zusmani/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks) are ideal for this project. 

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Predicting-the-Performance-of-a-Song-Classification-Model.git
   cd Predicting-the-Performance-of-a-Song-Classification-Model
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   Run the data preprocessing script to clean and prepare the dataset:
   ```bash
   python preprocess_data.py --input_dir data/song_data.csv
   ```

2. **Train the Model**  
   Train the song classification model:
   ```bash
   python train.py --dataset data/processed_data.csv --epochs 50 --batch_size 32
   ```

3. **Evaluate the Model**  
   Evaluate the model on a test dataset:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py --model saved_model.h5 --test_data data/test_data.csv
   ```

4. **Run Inference on New Songs**  
   Use the model to predict the performance of new songs:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --input path_to_song_features.csv --model saved_model.h5
   ```

## Model Architecture

The model is a multi-layer neural network designed to process song features and output class predictions or performance metrics. Key layers include:

- Fully connected layers for feature extraction.
- Dropout layers to reduce overfitting.
- Output layer with softmax activation for classification tasks.

### Training Parameters

- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy (for classification)
- Batch Size: 32
- Learning Rate: 0.001

## Results

The model provides predictions on song classification and potential performance. Here are sample results for classification accuracy:

| Metric          | Value      |
|-----------------|------------|
| Classification Accuracy | 0.87      |
| Precision       | 0.85       |
| Recall          | 0.86       |
